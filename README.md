## Introduction <a name="heading-introduction"></a>

Welcome to my Semester 3 portfolio at Fontys University of Applied Sciences in the field of ICT. I'm Gijs, and this individual project overview showcases a comprehensive collection of information about my chosen individual project, relevant documentation, and various other highlights from this semester.

We had the opportunity to collaborate on this project either individually or in pairs. I chose to take on this project solo, which I'll explain further in the project description below.

## About the Project <a name="heading-about-the-project"></a>

This semester, I have developed a script tailored for Adobe After Effects. This script, named 'fxWizard', assumes the role of a tool for handling an array of tasks related to the manipulation of effects within Adobe After Effects. Whether it's the addition, removal, or modification of effects, fxWizard stands ready to simplify these processes.

This project is primarily divided into two main components: the script and the web application. The script's primary function is to communicate with the web application, retrieving user-specific information for logged-in users. Given the rather specialized nature of the project I've been handling, I've opted to work on it independently. After all, a significant number of individuals at my school are not that familiar with After Effects, let alone its scripting language.
